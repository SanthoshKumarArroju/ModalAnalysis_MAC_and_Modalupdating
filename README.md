# Model Assurance Criterion and Model correction 
This is an Independent study on Modal Analysis and FEA Test correlation of a cruise missile wing. Wing-FE was modeled using WFEM(Matlab) module. Testing was conducted in a Laboratory enviroment using impact testing methodology using NIMAX DAQ via OpenModal(Python)  module.
The comparison and correction techniques were systematically done in Jupyter notebook.
