# Model Assurance Criterion and Model correction or updating: 

This is an Independent study to explore Modal Updating of FE models using Test data. 

FE models like 3D Beam and 8 noded Brick elements were coded in MATLAB and validated with Ansys Apdl. 

Testing was done in a laboratory environment using an open source experimental modal analysis software called "OpenModal" which had been validated with existing Bobcat commercial software.

The project is systematically explained in the Python jupyter notebook.
