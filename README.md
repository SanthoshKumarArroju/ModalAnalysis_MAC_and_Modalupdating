# Model Assurance Criterion and Model correction or updating: 

This is an Independent study on Modal Analysis and FEA Test correlation of a cruise missile wing. Wing-FE was modeled using WFEM(Matlab) module by developing a code and input file for 3D beam/rod/torsion element(6 d.o.f/node) and 8 noded Brick element for Modeling and Analysis . Testing was conducted in a Laboratory environment using impact testing methodology using NIMAX DAQ sytem for collecting data via OpenModal(Python)  software which had been completely installed with the lab test equipment and validated with existing Bobcat DAQ results.
The comparison and correction or modal updating techniques were systematically done in Jupyter notebook.
