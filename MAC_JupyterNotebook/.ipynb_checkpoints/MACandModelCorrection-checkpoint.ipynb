    "A complex vector simply includes both amplitude and phase, whereas a real vector is real part only. In Equation, it is also clear that the MAC is not sensitive to scaling, so if all mode shape components are multiplied with the same factor, the MAC will not be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an experimental modal analysis had 18 different nodes where measurements were made, the mode shape components at all 18 nodes are taken into account to calculate the MAC value, but more importance will be attributed to the higher amplitude node locations.\n",

    "A Modal Assurance Criterion (or MAC) analysis can be used in several different ways:\n",

    "* FEA-FEA comparison – Several assumptions can be made in the creation of a FEA analysis: Young’s Modulus, boundary conditions, and mass density values to name a few. A MAC analysis can determine the degree to which these assumptions affect the resulting mode shapes.\n",
    "* FEA-Test comparison – A MAC can be used to compare modes from an experimental modal analysis test to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It will indicate if the same mode shapes are found in both the test and FEA analysis."
